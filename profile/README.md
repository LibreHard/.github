# LibreHard

**Open, high-speed hardware. Built with Love. Powered by community.**

LibreHard is an open-source hardware initiative focused on designing high-speed enterprise hardware. The hardware is designed using full custom tools.

We build not just hardware — but an ecosystem around transparency, collaboration, and innovation.

## 🧪 Vision

We’re building an **open-source hardware design stack** that’s:
